    "contact.about.0": "AVefi means “Automated Consortium System for Audiovisual Holdings via Uniform Film Identifiers”. It was developed in November 2023 as part of an infrastructure cooperation project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). AVefi brings together film metadata from various institutions, making it both searchable and reusable for research purposes. The consortium system, including a research and editorial interface, complements the existing ecosystem of film identifiers and standard data (e.g. Filmportal, EIDR, GND, NFDI4Culture). It is an original offering with a strong focus on film holdings. AVefi serves the permanent identification and linking of audiovisual holdings of any origin, genre, and film type, by the principles of Linked Open Data and FAIR",
    "contact.about.1": "Metadata for feature films, educational, instructional, and scientific films, as well as amateur films and home movies, are now searchable, aggregated, and available for research for the first time. The records for film works of the data-providing institutions are automatically compared, and, if necessary, merged as far as possible. Persistent identifiers (PIDs) play a central role. With their help, films and their versions can be automatically and uniquely related. Film components stored in different archives can thus be found more easily in the future to be used for restoration purposes or to answer film-driven research questions.",

    "contact.about.2.afterLink": ". Evidence is provided at the three levels Work/Variant, Manifestation, and Item",
    "contact.about.heading": "About AVefi",
    "contact.workContent.0": "The data model is designed to assign collection inventory data to a holding institution uniquely, while at the same time representing relationships between the inventories of different institutions. PIDs, known by their German acronym “efi”, are generated for various classes of objects with their individual requirements. A distinction is made between (film) works, manifestations, and items following the FIAF rules.",
    "contact.workContent.1": "Work/Variant",
    "contact.workContent.2": "A work is an entity that encompasses the intellectual or artistic content and the process of realization in a cinematographic medium, e.g. what the film is called, when it was shot, who shot it, who was in it, what it is about, etc. This core information usually does not change in a manifestation.",
    "contact.workContent.3": "Manifestation",
    "contact.workContent.4": "A manifestation is the embodiment of a film work or a variant. Manifestations include all analog, digital, and online media. Information at the manifestation level may include a description of what the respective manifestation should ideally contain, regardless of the elements present in the archive. For example, the original runtime of a film might be 1: 30: 00, but the manifestation in the archive may be shorter due to missing film material.",
    "contact.workContent.5": "Item",
    "contact.workContent.6": "An item is the physical product of a manifestation of a work or a variant, i.e. the physical copy of a work or a variant. An item may consist of one or more components, i.e. the entire item may consist of one reel or five spools, two VHS tapes, or one DVD. An item record may include fields or areas for separate barcodes and condition information for each component of the item (e.g. each spool) as needed. The item may be complete, incomplete, or a fragment. For purely digital media, an item is defined as the availability of the file, regardless of the number of backup copies that may exist.",
